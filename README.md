Power BI Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive sales and profitability analysis dashboard built using Power BI. The project aims to visualize and analyze sales data to identify key trends, top-performing products, and regional performance metrics.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into the company's sales and profit performance across different product categories and states. By interactively exploring the data, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies, manage inventory, and improve overall profitability.

Key Analyses & Visualizations
The dashboard is comprised of several key components:

Profitability by State: A line chart that visualizes the profit distribution across various states, highlighting top-performing and underperforming regions. This helps in identifying areas with high market potential and those requiring strategic intervention.

Top 25 Products Analysis (Sales & Profit):

A Donut Chart illustrates the sales contribution of the top 25 products, showcasing which items are driving the most revenue.

A Pie Chart breaks down the profit contribution from these same top products, revealing which are the most profitable.

Product Category Analysis:

An interactive Bar Chart displays the count of products within each primary category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology), providing an overview of the product portfolio.

A Slicer/Filter for Sub-Category allows for granular analysis, enabling users to drill down into specific product segments like Chairs, Phones, Storage, and Tables.

Key Insights
This dashboard enables users to derive valuable insights, such as:

Identifying the most profitable states and products.

Understanding the relationship between high sales volume and actual profitability.

Analyzing the performance of different product categories and sub-categories to inform marketing and inventory decisions
